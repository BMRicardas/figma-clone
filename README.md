# Figma Clone

## Description

This Figma clone is a web application built to explore various libraries and technologies for front-end development. It provides a platform for creating and editing design prototypes, aiming to replicate some of Figma's core functionalities.

## Learning Objectives

- **Framework**: Next.js - Mastered building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **Collaboration**: @liveblocks - Explored real-time collaboration features, enabling users to work together on designs.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui - Experimented with accessible user interface components.
- **Utility Libraries**: Utilized various libraries like class-variance-authority, clsx, fabric, jspdf, lucide-react to enhance application functionality.
- **React & DOM**: Solidified foundation in building user interfaces with React and React DOM.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - Explored utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

## Technical Stack

- **Front-end**: Next.js, React, React DOM
- **Collaboration**: @liveblocks/client, @liveblocks/react, @liveblocks/react-comments
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Utility Libraries**: class-variance-authority, clsx, fabric, jspdf, lucide-react
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Tailwind CSS Animate
- **Other**: uuid

## Development Tools

- **TypeScript**: Enhanced code maintainability and type safety.
- **ESLint, eslint-config-next**: Maintained code quality and identified potential issues through linting.
- **Autoprefixer, PostCSS**: Ensured cross-browser compatibility for CSS styles.

## Reflection
